        <li>Bake in th preheated oven until edges are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Slightly cool cake in the pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat shortening and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Slowly beat in 3 cups confectioners' sugar until smooth. Mix water and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into confectioners' sugar mixture; add remaining confectioners'
            sugar and mix until buttercream is smooth. Add more water to thin, if needed.</li>
        <li>Spread buttercream onto cookie cake.</li>
